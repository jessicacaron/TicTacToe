## Project Overview
Classic game of tictactoe built using C# and a high scores table.


## Technologies:
C#
Visual Studio

## Project Description:
Gameplay:
One user clicks the start button to begin, then users take turns one at a time clicking on the boxes until one player gets three in a row. After the game is finished, the scores are updated to reflect the games played.

## Time to complete:
 2 Weeks

## Challenges:
For this project, the game logic was relatively simple. Getting the board to update all scores was tricky but I set variables to keep track of each win and used conditionals to ensure the scores tracked correctly.
